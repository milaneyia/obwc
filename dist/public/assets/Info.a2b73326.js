Beatmapping World Championship 2021 - Summary of the Official Documentation (osu!)\n\n**Read the full documentation [here](https://gist.github.com/zeusminus/5b7cac0cbd6bcec422776dac5085f25f).**\n\n## Website\n\n### Introduction\n\nFor this edition of the osu! Beatmapping World Championship, we are using a website in order to make things easier to manage. The website will also register your country flag, which will be very important for the team formation process.\n\n### Registration\n\nThe registration of your team will be done through the website, please note that you (or your teammates) don’t need to have any ranked mapsets to register your team or participate in the contest. Please be aware that the country you’re applying for is the one displayed on your osu! profile.\n\nOn the Team Creation page, you will be asked to fill out your team name and choose your team members. This is supposed to be done by the Team Captain. *No more edits of your team will be allowed once the deadline is passed.*\n\nYour team name should abide by the following so as to avoid occurences:\n- it shouldn't be inappropriate or insulting\n- it should fit under 16 characters\n- it shouldn't contain non-standard/unicode characters\n\n### Submission\n\nTo submit your entry, the Team Captain will submit the entry through the website. The submission process will remain the same during the whole contest. Please note that you are allowed to edit your submission as long as the deadline is respected.\n\nThe Team Captain will be the only person to have access to the team’s submission page (unless special circumstances) and will be the first person to be contacted by the Staff members if needed. \n\n*No delays will be tolerated (except for specific circumstances).*\n\n## Contest Format\n\n### Contest Rounds\n\nThere are 4 rounds in total for this contest.  A team must participate at least 3 rounds (this means 3 rounds of valid submissions) to be eligible to win any prize.\n\nThere is no limit on the number of teams registered from one country. However, at the end of Round 1, if a country has multiple teams successfully participated this round, only the team with highest score will proceed to the next rounds as other teams from this country will be eliminated.\n\nA typical round consists of 3 sections: the mapping section, the judging section and the showcase section.\n\n- Mapping section: The team is able to select **1** out of **2** songs announced at the beginning of the mapping section.\n- Judging section: Entries submitted by teams will be anonymized and sent to the Judges for review and score. \n- Showcase section: When all the scores are collected from Judges, map submissions of this round will be displayed via showcase.\n\n*Note: Only the First Round results (teams that can proceed and teams that will be eliminated) will be announced during its showcase section. The results of succeeding rounds will remain confidential until the contest concludes. This is to encourage teams staying in this contest till the end and not get unexpectedly impacted by intermediate results.*\n\n### Players' Pick\n\nA new prize makes its appearence in the osu! Beatmapping World Championship this year, the **Players' Pick**. A batch of 5 professional players (above #5000) will evaluate the entries under a specific judging criteria. Note that results of Players' Pick will not influence the mapper judges as described in the leaderboard section below.\n\n### Leaderboard\n\nIn this contest, there are two leaderboards corresponding to the two types of Judges. Leaderboard of scores from Player Judges or Mapper Judges are independent. Leaderboard illustrates the ranking of teams by their accumulated score in this contest, from highest to lowest. The accumulated score is calculated by summing the 3 highest scores out of 4 rounds obtained by the team in this contest. This is to encourage teams staying in this contest and provide opportunity for a comeback for the teams that may not do well in certain rounds.\n\n## Judging stage\n\nFor the first time in the osu! Beatmapping World Championship, we decided to put some spice in it. At the end of Round 1, results of which teams can proceed and which teams are eliminated will be announced. However, results and leaderboards will be kept confidential during the rest of the contest until the live stream showcase at the very end.\n\n### Judges\n\n1. **Mapper Judge**: There are two batches of mapper judges, each of which consists of 7 judges, accounting for a grand total of 14 judges. They are responsible for the evaluation of the submissions from a mapper perspective.\n\n    - **Cohesion (30%)**: This criterion will focus on how consistent the map is. All elements of the map has to remain coherent with the rhythm and the music. For instance, if the entry represents the music well and the sections from different members are integrated seamlessly without weird transitions and abrupt spikes, that entry deserves to be praised.\n    - **Expertise (30%)**: Our judges are also expected to focus on the advanced skills or expertise of mapping. A map with high expertise shows excellent management over note patterns, flows, movements, and even hitsounds. Those maps are outstanding compared with their peers in this contest and mark themselves as top-tier in the state-of-the-art mapping community.\n    - **Creativity (30%)**: As with everything, beatmaps and mapping techniques are subject to change over time. Moreover, the history of osu!mapping is always shaped by creative maps, showing an avant-garde or even ahead-of-time understanding of mapping. Creative yet solid maps are the art of osu! and thus definitely promoted in this contest.\n    - **Judge's Impression (10%)**: Judges can use this for extra scores or penalties for their specific comments or remarks on something in the entry.\n\n2. **Player Judge**: There are 5 player judges in total. They are responsible for the evaluation of the submissions from a player perspective.\n\n    - **Sophistication (30%)**: This criterion will focus on how comfortable it is to play the beatmap, according to its difficulty level. As much as they can be considered pieces of art, beatmaps are defined as in-game levels made for users to enjoy them. Therefore, for them to gain players' attraction, they need to be player-friendly first.\n    - **Profundity (30%)**: Players are supposed to rate the quality of the beatmap by looking at nothing but its structure. Playing a super-simple jump/stream map might be fun, but we are here to have a competition here after all! Establishing complex mapping structures can take vast amounts of time and effort. Thus players are supposed to take the profundities of the beatmaps into account during their evaluation.\n    - **Uniqueness (30%)**: Throughout the history of osu!, we can see that beatmaps displaying unique patterns usually be the centre of community attention and sometimes even become era-defining masterpieces. With that in mind, we would like to draw players' attention to the artistic aspects of mapping and see where their opinions revolve.\n    - **Player's Impression (10%)**: Players are asked to note down their personal thoughts and subjective opinions regarding the beatmap and rate it accordingly.\n\nScores from judges will be standardized before adding to the leaderboard. Sum of all the judges' standardized scores is the score the team will obtain in this round, and will be added to the leaderboard.\n\n### Contest rules\n\n1. **The [osu!
